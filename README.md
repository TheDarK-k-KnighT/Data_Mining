# Data Mining

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model by training on a dataset containing 2500 rows and 68 attributes.
Then carry out predictions on the test data of dimension 1647 * 68 which can further be used to calculate balanced error rate.
Supervised learning techniques like SVM, Random Forest Ensemble, Bootstrapping, etc. are used to achieve least training error before making predictions.
